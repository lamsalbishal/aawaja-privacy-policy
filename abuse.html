  <h1>Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (CSAE) Policy</h1>

  <h2>Moderation and Detection</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>All content is monitored using AI-based scanning (e.g., Google Cloud Vision, Microsoft Content Moderator).</li>
    <li>Manual moderation is used for flagged content.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Reporting Abuse</h2>
  <p>If you see any harmful or CSAE-related content, report it immediately via our in-app report feature or email: <a href="mailto:abuse@yourdomain.com">abuse@yourdomain.com</a>.</p>

  <h2>Cooperation with Authorities</h2>
  <p>We cooperate with local and international law enforcement to support investigations into CSAE cases.</p>
